# NightcoreNoNo
Pushed straight from backup drive  
Status: Outdated? , Production

Selenium program for blocking nightcore on site plug.dj
firefox base.

My first python project EVER created, was created on linux for linux. 
It asks for username and pass for site logins, logs you in and puts you into nightblue3's room.
After that it checks if song title has nightcore in it and if it does it mutes the song, it does this check every 2 seconds
and if the song has changed, it will unmute the player.
